    If you're reading this, it means you are either really curious about our puzzles or you want to be our new web dev.
    Either way, we hope you enjoy this experience. This is the first time we are trying this, so we are hoping for a positive result. 
    Before you really begin, here are some things to be aware of:<br><br><br>
    1. At the end of this puzzle, you will be given a completion code. Email this code to josh@pentport.com and we will be in touch.<br><br>
    2. Do not try to cheat. We will know and we will laugh as we ignore your email.<br><br>
    3. Don't think too hard. We are looking for another web dev for a reason. The ideal candidate is more advanced in 
    web development than any of us, so if you're a good fit, this shouldn't require a ton of effort.
