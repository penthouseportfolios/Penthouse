"I've constantly been getting told that I needed a track record to get funding to invest,</br>
but I'm a teenager with no money, so I couldn't get a track record.</br>
Seeing all of my ideas come to fruition while I just had to sit there and watch.</br>
It's like being the NBA with an injury. All I want to do is play the game.</br>
A while back I made this program that actually turned out to be really accurate,</br>
on some days even perfect, at predicting stock prices. I have this great program and these great ideas,</br>
but still no funding. So, I decided that instead of continuing trying to find someone else to fund my ideas,</br>
I'm going to sell my program so I can fund my ideas myself."</br>
